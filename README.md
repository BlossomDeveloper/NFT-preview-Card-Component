## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to overlap an image over an image and change the background color when hover, was very interesting to actually make it work but I made it! :D

### Continued development

I will keep doing this small projects in order to practice more over HTML and CSS. 

### Useful resources

-  W3 Schools (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me with image overlap on other image on hover.
